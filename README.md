# sim_hive_controller

Simulation of the hive controller hardware for IOC development

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/buzz-metrics/sim-hive-controller>
:---:           | :---:
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/buzz-metrics/sim-hive-controller:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/buzz-metrics/sim-hive-controller/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from sim_hive_controller import __version__

print(f"Hello sim_hive_controller {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m sim_hive_controller --version
```
